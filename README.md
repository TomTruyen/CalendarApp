# CalendarApp

## TODO

- Fix Task_Screen.Dart validations ==> No empty Title (everything else is fine :))
- Replace the date & timepicker with the default android date & time picker (they are just better)
- Make sure that the endTime is always after the startTime (this is the case now but with the new pickers this might fail?)
- Design task detail screen

- Dark Theme & Light Theme Styling
